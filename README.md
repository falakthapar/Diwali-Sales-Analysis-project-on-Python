# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-project-on-Python

In this project, I have made an exploratory data analysis of the of the sales which happened during diwali. I have tried to find out the most potential customer group to target in order to increase sales and revenue for the company.

The link for the raw data is: [Diwali_Sales_Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjwJC3EKwokqyCj-1Q8GhAVgRF3X_789/view?usp=sharing).This file is a CSV file with all the data about the sales that happened during diwali.

I have followed these steps while making this project:
<ul><li>Data Filtering</li>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
    <li>Visulisation of Data</li>
    <li>Profile Report</li>
    <li>Short Summary of all the Data with Conclusion</li>
</ul>
